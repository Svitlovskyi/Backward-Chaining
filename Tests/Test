#AND conditions and conclusions
#The program can handle basic AND conditions, and AND conclusions.

#Z => A
#! A + B => K
#! C | K => G

#if ! before operator -> error.

A ^ B => C
# A and B are True, so C is False
D ^ E => F
# Only D is True, so F is True
G ^ H => I
# Only H is True, so I is True
J ^ K => L
 # J and K are False, so J is False
